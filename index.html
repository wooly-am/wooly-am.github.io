<p>Hildegarde, O vis aeternitatis</p>
<p>This recording was sung by a vocal ensemble, and alternates between solo and ‘tutti’ sections. In the background, an 
instrument I cannot easily identify drones a note at the tonal center, like a recitative tone. There are some passages that 
seem to require at least some skill; the piece has a few large jumps, requires a larger range, and has some ornamentation. Perhaps 
the skill of music became more desirable around this time.</p>
<p>From my perspective, one of the most alienating features of this music is how quickly the melody changes direction, especially 
in ‘Sol oritur occasus nescius’. It’s difficult to predict what note or interval will come next. However, this seems like a product 
of the music’s original purpose. Music written in this style would make it easier to memorize the words, and should not feature broad
 melodic trends or repetition in the same way music today does. I have two personal anecdotes that support this. When I worked at a 
 bike shop, I was given some advice that rhymed, which was a problem because the critical words were interchangeable. “Grease the pole
 not the hole” and “grease the hole not the pole” both worked the same way rhythmically and had the same rhyme scheme, meaning it was 
 really easy to mess up. Different words over the same repeated phrase would have a similar effect. Certain vowels seem to correspond
 better with higher or lower notes (it’s easier to make a low o sound than i), so given an already written text, it would feel more 
 natural to have it jump around to accustom the vowel. When I memorized my phone number, It semi-consciously slipped into a melody, 
 with each number corresponding with a note. It’s disjunct, but if it was arranged more “melodically” it would not be so easy to 
 memorize.</p>
