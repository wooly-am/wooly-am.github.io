<p>Hildegarde, O vis aeternitatis</p>
<p>This recording was sung by a vocal ensemble, and alternates between solo and ‘tutti’ sections. In the background, an 
instrument I cannot easily identify drones a note at the tonal center, like a recitative tone. There are some passages that 
seem to require at least some skill; the piece has a few large jumps, requires a larger range, and has some ornamentation. Perhaps 
the skill of music became more desirable around this time.</p>
<p>From my perspective, one of the most alienating features of this music is how quickly the melody changes direction, especially 
in ‘Sol oritur occasus nescius’. It’s difficult to predict what note or interval will come next. However, this seems like a product 
of the music’s original purpose. Music written in this style would make it easier to memorize the words, and should not feature broad
 melodic trends or repetition in the same way music today does. I have two personal anecdotes that support this. When I worked at a 
 bike shop, I was given some advice that rhymed, which was a problem because the critical words were interchangeable. “Grease the pole
 not the hole” and “grease the hole not the pole” both worked the same way rhythmically and had the same rhyme scheme, meaning it was 
 really easy to mess up. Different words over the same repeated phrase would have a similar effect. Certain vowels seem to correspond
 better with higher or lower notes (it’s easier to make a low o sound than i), so given an already written text, it would feel more 
 natural to have it jump around to accustom the vowel. When I memorized my phone number, It semi-consciously slipped into a melody, 
 with each number corresponding with a note. It’s disjunct, but if it was arranged more “melodically” it would not be so easy to 
 memorize.</p>
<p>	Fanny Hensel was a German musician and composer in the romantic era. Perhaps unfortunately, she is 
better known as Felix Mendelsohnn’s sister, in part because of her limited involvement with the public 
which was expected of her due to her sex and class. </p>
<p>I do like the idea of Das Jahr. I’m a big fan of programmatic, or otherwise extra-musically inspired 
works, and I find the idea of prescribing music to the year interesting. January: Most of the beginning 
part is only one voice, until about 2:00. I liked the restatement of the first part’s melody at 2:40, 
and its subsequent variations. This piece leads directly into the next one, February: An abrupt change 
of character to a fast compound meter that feels like 6/8 or 12/8. There are a lot of dynamic crescendos 
and decrescendos that the performer does a great job of playing. It almost sounds like a brisk winter 
wind. I’m reminded of the anecdote during the lecture about a husband bragging that his wife plays the 
piano like an angel. I wonder why this one doesn't lead into the next the way January did. May: This 
“Spring song” has an iambic rhythmic structure throughout, perhaps not in the same way an ars nova piece 
would be, but in a romantic allusion to poetry and folk song. September: The constant 16th notes create 
constant motion, and by outline the chords give a strong harmonic presence. The middle sections seems to 
be a long sturm und drang, admittedly losing intensity at some points, before returning to the first 
section at 2:56</p>
<p>I’m reminded of the Pettler article that seems to have an unabashed bias against early romantic work 
as “showy”. This distrust of the public’s taste would likely be a motivating factor for Hensel and her 
family's caution when publishing and performing in public. If Pettler’s perspective is to be internalized
, performing works in the public’s tastes (giving the people what they want) is anything but modest. 
Perhaps a more crucial motivating factor for Clara Schumann’s “sober” repertoire was not guiding the 
public to “better” music, but changing status to a respectable lady performer.</p>
